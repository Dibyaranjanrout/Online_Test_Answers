3 Tier Architecture Environment:
--------------------------------------

This architecture is used in a client-server application such as a web application that has the frontend, the backend and the database.

I have made use of the following AWS services to build a design of three-tier cloud infrastructure.

- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
- Auto Scaling Group,
- Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
- Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- Security Groups and the Internet Gateway.

Flow:

Steps to create
----------------------

- We have to create a Virtual Private Cloud VPC.
  Go to the VPC section of the AWS services, and click on the Create VPC button.
  CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/16
  
- Setup the Internet Gateway
  Select the VPC to attach the internet gateway
  
- We have to create 4 subnets with the following

  demo-public-subnet-1 | CIDR (10.0.1.0/24) | Availability Zone (us-east-1a)
  demo-public-subnet-2 | CIDR (10.0.2.0/24) | Availability Zone (us-east-1b)
  demo-private-subnet-3 | CIDR (10.0.3.0/24) | Availability Zone (us-east-1a)
  demo-private-subnet-4 | CIDR(10.0.4.0/24) | Availability Zone (us-east-1b)
  
- Create Two Route Tables
- We need two route tables; private route table and public route table. The public route table will define which subnets that will have direct access to the internet ( ie public subnets) while the private route table will define which subnet goes through the NAT gateway (ie private subnet).

- Create the NAT Gateway:
  We will be editing the private route table to make use of the NAT gateway to access the internet.
  
- Create Elastic Load Balancer

- Configure the Load Balancer with a name. 
  Select internet facing for the load balancer that we will use to communicate with the frontend and internal for the one we will use for our backend.
  
- Under the Availability Zone, for the internet facing Load Balancer, we will select the two public subnets while for our internal Load Balancer, we will select the two private subnet.

- Under the Security Group, we only need to allow ports that the application needs. For instance, we need to allow HTTP port 80 and/or HTTPS port 443 on our internet facing load balancer

- Under the Configure Routing, we need to configure our Target Group to have the Target type of instance. We will give the Target Group a name that will enable us to identify it.

- Create a Auto Scaling Group.
  We Choose the appropriate instance type
  
- Create aBastion Host
  The bastion host is just an EC2 instance that sits in the public subnet to connect to provate subnet
